# 🎰 BaseBets: Decentralized Slot Machine Platform

**BaseBets** is a revolutionary decentralized slot machine platform built on the Base blockchain, featuring a unique **manager-clone architecture** that enables scalable, fair, and provably transparent gambling experiences. The system leverages **Pyth Network** for verifiable randomness and **USDC** for all betting operations, creating a trustless gaming ecosystem where every spin is cryptographically verifiable.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Core Components

The BaseBets platform consists of two main smart contracts that work together to create a scalable slot machine ecosystem:

#### 1. **MainSlotManager** - The Central Hub
The `MainSlotManager` serves as the central orchestrator of the entire platform:

- **🔄 Clone Deployment**: Deploys new `SlotMachine` contracts as gas-efficient clones using OpenZeppelin's `Clones` library
- **💰 Shared Jackpot Pool**: Manages a single, massive progressive jackpot that grows across ALL slot machines
- **📊 Centralized Statistics**: Tracks total volume, spins, and jackpot wins across the entire platform
- **🎯 Jackpot Distribution**: Handles jackpot wins with odds that scale proportionally to bet size
- **⚙️ Global Configuration**: Sets platform-wide parameters like house edge, jackpot contribution rates, and randomness refresh intervals

#### 2. **SlotMachine** - Individual Gaming Units
Each `SlotMachine` is a cloneable contract that handles individual gaming operations:

- **🎲 Provably Fair Gaming**: Uses Pyth Network price feeds combined with block data for verifiable randomness
- **💵 USDC Integration**: Accepts bets in USDC with fixed denominations (1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100 USDC)
- **🎰 Symbol-Based Gameplay**: Features 4 symbols (Bar, Cherries, Watermelon, Coinbase Logo) across 3 reels
- **📈 Optimized Payouts**: Tuned payout table achieving ~90% Return to Player (RTP)
- **🔄 Automatic Contributions**: Automatically contributes 5% of each bet to the shared jackpot pool

## 🎯 Key Features & Innovations

### 🔐 Provably Fair Randomness
- **Pyth Network Integration**: Uses real-world price feeds (BTC/USD) as entropy sources
- **Hybrid Randomness**: Combines Pyth price data with blockchain entropy (`block.timestamp`, `tx.origin`, `gasleft()`)
- **Per-Spin Seeds**: Each spin uses `keccak256(baseRandomness, txHash, spinCount)` for unique, verifiable randomness
- **Periodic Updates**: Base randomness refreshes every 1,000 spins to maintain unpredictability

### 💰 Progressive Jackpot System
- **Shared Pool**: Single jackpot pool grows from ALL slot machines across the platform
- **Proportional Odds**: Higher bets increase jackpot win probability (1 in ~1M to 1 in ~100K odds)
- **Automatic Contributions**: 5% of every bet automatically feeds the progressive jackpot
- **Scaling Rewards**: Jackpot odds scale with bet size, making larger bets more attractive

### 🎰 Optimized Game Mechanics
- **Symbol Combinations**: 
  - 3x Bar → 15x payout (rare)
  - 2x Bar → 8x payout  
  - 1x Bar → 3x payout
  - 3x Cherries → 6x payout
  - 3x Watermelon → 4x payout
  - 3x Coinbase Logo → 12x payout (rare)
- **90% RTP**: Mathematically tuned payout table ensures sustainable house edge
- **Fixed Bet Amounts**: Prevents dust attacks and simplifies UX

### 🏛️ Economic Model
- **House Edge**: 5% on regular winnings (not total bet)
- **Jackpot Contribution**: 5% of each bet feeds the progressive jackpot
- **Total House Take**: ~10% of total volume (5% house + 5% jackpot)
- **Player Returns**: ~90% RTP on regular spins + progressive jackpot opportunities

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Smart Contract Architecture

```solidity
// Manager deploys clones and manages shared jackpot
MainSlotManager {
    - deployNewSlotMachine() → creates SlotMachine clone
    - depositToJackpot() → slot machines contribute to shared pool
    - tryJackpotWin() → handles jackpot win logic
    - getManagerStats() → platform-wide statistics
}

// Individual slot machines handle gameplay
SlotMachine {
    - spin() → executes game logic with Pyth randomness
    - updateRandomness() → refreshes base entropy from Pyth
    - getSlotMachineStats() → individual machine statistics
}
```

### Pyth Network Integration

The system leverages Pyth Network's decentralized price feeds for provably fair randomness:

```solidity
// Base randomness combines multiple entropy sources
baseRandomness = keccak256(
    price.price,      // Pyth BTC/USD price
    price.conf,       // Price confidence interval
    block.timestamp,  // Block timestamp
    block.difficulty, // Block difficulty
    tx.origin         // Transaction origin
);

// Per-spin randomness
randomSeed = keccak256(baseRandomness, txHash, spinCount);
```

### Clone-Based Deployment

Using OpenZeppelin's `Clones` library for gas-efficient deployment:

- **Implementation Contract**: Single `SlotMachine` implementation deployed once
- **Clone Deployment**: New slot machines deployed as minimal proxies
- **Gas Efficiency**: ~95% gas savings compared to full contract deployment
- **Upgradeability**: New implementations can be deployed without affecting existing clones
